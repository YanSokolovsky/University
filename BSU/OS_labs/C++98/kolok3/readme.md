The directory contains input text files named as follows: in_<N>.dat, where N is a natural number. 
Each file consists of two lines. The first line contains the number denoting the action, and the second line contains floating point numbers separated by a space.
The actions can be as follows:
1 - addition
2 - multiplication
3 - sum of squares
You need to write a multithreaded application that will perform the required actions on the numbers and write the sum of the results to the file out.dat.
The name of the working directory is passed as a working string argument (the number of threads is the same)
